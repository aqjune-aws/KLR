# Kernel Language Representation (KLR)

This repository contains an implementation of KLR, a core language and
elaborators for machine learning kernels. The goal of KLR is to define a common
representation for kernel functions with a precise formal semantics along with
translations from common kernel languages to the KLR core language. The initial
focus of KLR is the
[Neuron Kernel Interface](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/index.html),
and the [Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/) hardware.
